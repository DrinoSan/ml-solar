    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Company XY introduced solar panels and accompanying batteries to make them self, less dependent on the main grid and therefore reduce their overall energy dependance and CO2 emissions. First phase of the project was successfully completed with installation of solar panels and accompanying batteries. The goal of the second phase is to analyze their consumption and try to reduce the usage of the main grid electricity to zero by using ML for prediction of next possible window where electricity from main grid will be needed. Current analysis has shown that the consumption of energy from main grid is still present and therefore the ML should be deployed to make predictions when the next possible usage from the main grid will take place so that the energy management team can put some measurements in place to prohibit such usage. For example, energy consumption should be reduced during this time to overcome the upcoming need for electricity from main grid.\n",
